## Usage

## Game Rules

1. The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.

2. Each player is dealt two cards, and they can choose to hit (take another card) or stand (keep their current hand).

3. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points, Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, and all other cards are worth their face value.
    - However, currently the game treats 'Ace' as 1

4. The game ends when a player or the dealer hits 21, goes over 21, or both stand.
